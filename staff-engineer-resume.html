            </header>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Built a first-of-its-kind fintech platform that applies behavioral finance principles to real-world
                  trading data. Delivered personalized, data-driven insights that help active investors understand and
                  improve their decision-making.</li>
                <li>Served as the technical lead in presenting the platform to external evaluators, successfully
                  addressing scaling and security requirements. The platform's engineering strength and analytical rigor
                  led to acceptance into top-tier incubators including Creative Destruction Lab and Curinos Fintech Incubator.
                </li>
                <li>Architected and built a Dockerized Python backend serving a REST API for behavioral analytics. Chose
                  a monolithic architecture for early-stage velocity, modularizing analytics components into a
                  standalone Python package for a clear migration path to microservices.</li>
                <li>Designed and optimized a modular analytics engine capable of processing complex portfolio edge cases
                  with low latency. Engineered behavioral modules as a standalone Python package with >95% test
                  coverage, developer-friendly design, and clear extensibility—enabling scale, rapid onboarding, and
                  long-term maintainability.</li>
                <li>Developed the frontend using React and TypeScript, delivering responsive UIs for behavioral
                  reporting, an investing workflow engine, and user account management. Used RTK Query to cache
                  analytics responses
                  client-side, reducing backend load and improving user experience.</li>
                <li>Deployed infrastructure to DigitalOcean with containerized services managed via Docker. Enabled
                  horizontal scaling of frontend and backend containers behind load balancers; implemented prefetching
                  for market pricing data to reduce API latency.</li>
                <li>Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate test and deploy workflows.
                  Integrated New Relic for monitoring and alerting across frontend and backend services.</li>
                <li>Recruited and led a high-performing engineering team with a strong focus on mentorship through code
                  reviews, technical discussions, pairing sessions, regular one-on-ones, and structured annual
                  performance planning.

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>App lead for the contributor submission platform, which processes over 99% of all contributor image
                  uploads via a high-throughput Ruby on Rails backend and a React + TypeScript frontend. Personally led
                  architecture and implementation of frontend systems used by thousands of global contributors and
                  internal reviewers.</li>
                <li>Spearheaded the design and implementation of an AI-content tagging system in the Rails backend to
                  detect and flag AI-generated and AI-modified images across hundreds of thousands of daily submissions.
                  The company was then able to launch its own AI image generation product, unlocking a new multi-million
                  dollar revenue stream.</li>
                <li>Improved initial page load time by 50% through targeted frontend performance audits using PageSpeed
                  Insights. Refactored the app's bootstrap sequence, deferred non-critical API calls, and restructured
                  the
                  data-fetching layer to prioritize render-critical content.</li>
                <li>Took initiative to unblock and complete a stalled migration from react-scripts to Vite, improving
                  local development performance and boosting developer throughput by ~5%.
                </li>
                <li>Responded to critical production incidents as part of the on-call rotation, including bug triage and
                  system-level failures. Resolved a critical ElasticSearch cluster failure that disrupted content
                  delivery across the platform. Identified the root cause using internal observability tools and
                  leveraged our in-house AI system to generate recovery commands.</li>
                <li>Led the redesign of the team's hiring process, overhauling the interview structure and creating
                  candidate and interviewer guides. Resulting in the successful hiring of several top-performing
                  engineers and improved overall consistency across interviews.

              <ul>
                <li>Technical lead on the rebuild of kensingtontours.com, migrating from a legacy .NET MVC
                  to a modern Angular v4 SPA architecture. Introduced Redux for global state management to
                  persist user-selected tours across pages—boosting conversion rates and increasing lead generation by
                  ~5%.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with the VP of Marketing to ensure 99% uptime of lead generation forms, implement SEO
                  best practices, and integrate third-party analytics and marketing platforms. Co-led a Google-hosted
                  hackathon in NYC where the team placed 2nd by implementing Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), improving
                  mobile performance and engagement.</li>
                <li>Refactored the legacy PDF generation system, which was previously brittle and difficult to maintain.
                  Introduced modular design, unit testing, and separation of concerns—transforming it into a
                  maintainable
                  codebase that the full team could contribute to. Post-refactor, contribution expanded from 1 developer
                  to 10+.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy, automating build and
                  deployment workflows. Reduced deployment friction, empowered team-wide ownership of release processes,
                  and enabled faster iteration.</li>
                <li>Led the migration from a single-server deployment to a multi-server, load-balanced production
                  environment, enabling blue/green deployments and eliminating downtime. Improved system reliability
                  dramatically—reducing daily outages and raising uptime to nearly 99%.</li>
                <li>Provided mentorship to junior developers during the tech stack transition. Conducted code reviews,
                  enforced best practices in Node and Angular, and helped level up team capabilities through
                  architectural
                  guidance and paired debugging.</li>
