            </header>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Built a first-of-its-kind fintech platform that applies behavioral finance principles to real-world
                  trading data. Delivered personalized, data-driven insights that help active investors understand and
                  improve their decision-making.</li>
                <li>Served as the technical lead in presenting the platform to external evaluators, successfully
                  addressing scaling and security requirements. The platform's engineering strength and analytical rigor
                  led to acceptance into top-tier incubators including Creative Destruction Lab and Curinos Fintech
                  Incubator.
                </li>
                <li>Architected and built a Dockerized Python backend featuring a modular analytics engine, delivering a
                  REST API
                  for behavioral analytics capable of handling complex user portfolios. Key strengths include
                  low-latency processing, over 95% test coverage, and a developer-friendly design.</li>
                <li>Developed a responsive React and TypeScript frontend delivering behavioral insights and a guided
                  investment workflow. Insights helped users uncover over $100K in potential investing upsides, while
                  the workflow improved performance by over 20%, based on a study with the University of Cincinnati.
                </li>
                <li>Deployed containerized services on DigitalOcean using Docker to ensure scalable, consistent
                  performance across development and production. Built robust CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and
                  integrated New Relic for monitoring and alerts. The automation enabled rapid developer
                  onboarding, reducing time-to-first-commit from over a week to under two days, with engineers
                  deploying to production and confidently using observability tools to ensure safe, reliable releases.
                </li>
                <li>Recruited and led a high-performing engineering team with a strong focus on mentorship through code
                  reviews, technical discussions, pairing sessions, regular one-on-ones, and structured annual
                  performance planning.

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>App lead for the contributor submission platform, which processes over 99% of all contributor image
                  uploads via a high-throughput Ruby on Rails backend and a React + TypeScript frontend. Personally led
                  architecture and implementation of frontend systems used by thousands of global contributors and
                  internal reviewers.</li>
                <li>Spearheaded the design and implementation of an AI-content tagging system in the Rails backend to
                  detect and flag AI-generated and AI-modified images across hundreds of thousands of daily submissions.
                  The company was then able to launch its own AI image generation product, unlocking a new multi-million
                  dollar revenue stream.</li>
                <li>Improved initial page load time by 50% through targeted frontend performance audits using PageSpeed
                  Insights. Refactored the app's bootstrap sequence, deferred non-critical API calls, and restructured
                  the
                  data-fetching layer to prioritize render-critical content.</li>
                <li>Took initiative to unblock and complete a stalled migration from react-scripts to Vite, improving
                  local development performance and boosting developer throughput by ~5%.
                </li>
                <li>Took sole ownership of diagnosing and resolving a platform-wide ElasticSearch failure that halted
                  all content intake, threatening millions in lost assets. While others were unable to identify the
                  issue, was able to use internal observability tools to isolate the root cause and leveraged our
                  in-house AI
                  system to generate and execute recovery commands, restoring functionality under intense time pressure.
                </li>
                <li>Led the redesign of the team's hiring process, overhauling the interview structure and creating
                  candidate and interviewer guides. Resulting in the successful hiring of several top-performing
                  engineers and improved overall consistency across interviews.

              <ul>
                <li>Technical lead on the rebuild of kensingtontours.com, migrating from a legacy .NET MVC
                  to a modern Angular v4 SPA architecture. Introduced Redux for global state management to
                  persist user-selected tours across pages—boosting conversion rates and increasing lead generation by
                  ~5%.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with the VP of Marketing to ensure 99% uptime of lead generation forms, implement SEO
                  best practices, and integrate third-party analytics and marketing platforms. Co-led a Google-hosted
                  hackathon in NYC where the team placed 2nd by implementing Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), improving
                  mobile performance and engagement.</li>
                <li>Refactored the legacy PDF generation system, which was previously brittle and difficult to maintain.
                  Introduced modular design, unit testing, and separation of concerns—transforming it into a
                  maintainable
                  codebase that the full team could contribute to. Post-refactor, contribution expanded from 1 developer
                  to 10+.</li>
                <li>Led the migration from a single-server deployment to a multi-server, load-balanced production
                  environment, enabling blue/green deployments and eliminating downtime. Improved system reliability
                  dramatically—reducing daily outages and raising uptime to nearly 99%.</li>
                <li>Provided mentorship to junior developers during the tech stack transition. Conducted code reviews,
                  enforced best practices in Node and Angular, and helped level up team capabilities through
                  architectural
                  guidance and paired debugging.</li>
