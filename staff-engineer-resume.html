              <ul>
                <li>Led system design and hands-on implementation of a full-stack fintech platform offering behavioral
                  analytics and investment decision tools to traders and portfolio managers.</li>
                <li>Architected and built a Dockerized Python backend serving a REST API for behavioral analytics. Chose
                  a monolithic architecture for early-stage velocity, modularizing analytics components into a
                  standalone Python package for a clear migration path to microservices.</li>
                <li>Developed the frontend using React and TypeScript, delivering responsive UIs for behavioral
                  reporting, an investing workflow engine, and user account management. Used RTK Query to cache
                  analytics responses
                  client-side, reducing backend load and improving user experience.</li>
                <li>Designed a robust analytics package to ingest trading history and detect behavioral biases using
                  Pandas and NumPy. Given the financial nature of the analytics, the engine was built with >95% unit
                  test coverage to ensure
                  accuracy and reliability.
                </li>
                <li>Deployed infrastructure to DigitalOcean with containerized services managed via Docker. Enabled
                  horizontal scaling of frontend and backend containers behind load balancers; implemented prefetching
                  for market pricing data to reduce API latency.</li>
                <li>Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate test and deploy workflows;
                  integrated New Relic for monitoring and alerting across frontend and backend services.</li>
                <li>Recruited and led a high-performing engineering team with a strong focus on mentorship through code
                  reviews, technical discussions, pairing sessions, regular one-on-ones, and structured annual
                  performance planning.

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>App lead for the contributor submission platform, which processes over 99% of all contributor image
                  uploads via a high-throughput Ruby on Rails backend and a React + TypeScript frontend. Personally led
                  architecture and implementation of frontend systems used by thousands of global contributors and
                  internal reviewers.</li>
                <li>Improved initial page load time by 50% through targeted frontend performance audits using PageSpeed
                  Insights. Refactored the app's bootstrap sequence, deferred non-critical API calls, and restructured
                  the
                  data-fetching layer to prioritize render-critical content.</li>
                <li>Spearheaded implementation of a rate-limiting and throttling system after diagnosing performance
                  degradation caused by abusive traffic patterns. Used load testing (Siege) to benchmark system
                  capacity,
                  and collaborated with affected users to ensure transparency and continued platform trust.</li>
                <li>Took initiative to complete a stalled migration from react-scripts to Vite, unlocking significant
                  improvements in build time and local development speed. Led investigation and resolution of
                  incompatible
                  dependency issues, unblocking the team and modernizing the toolchain.</li>
                <li>Contributed to internal Electron-based tooling used by Getty's review teams, enabling efficient
                  management and quality assurance of user-submitted content.</li>
                <li>Served on support rotation, diagnosing and resolving production issues under pressure. Traced root
                  causes through logs and observability tools, implementing fixes with minimal downtime.</li>
                <li>Led the redesign of the team's hiring process—including interview structure, feedback rubrics, and
                  interviewer training—resulting in the recruitment of several high-performing engineers and improved
                  process consistency across the org.</li>

                  monolith to a modern Angular v4 SPA architecture. Introduced Redux for global state management to
                  persist user-selected tours across pages—boosting conversion rates and increasing lead generation by
                  ~5%.</li>

                <li>Refactored the legacy PDF generation system, which was previously brittle and difficult to maintain.
                  Introduced modular design, unit testing, and separation of concerns—transforming it into a
                  maintainable
                  codebase that the full team could contribute to. Post-refactor, contribution expanded from 1 developer
                  to 10+.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy, automating build and
                  deployment workflows. Reduced deployment friction, empowered team-wide ownership of release processes,
                  and enabled faster iteration.</li>
                <li>Successfully led a migration to a multi-server, load-balanced production environment, increasing
                  platform performance and scalability. Designed infrastructure to support future traffic growth while
                  minimizing risk during deployment.</li>
                <li>Provided mentorship to junior developers during the tech stack transition. Conducted code reviews,
                  enforced best practices in Node and Angular, and helped level up team capabilities through
                  architectural
                  guidance and paired debugging.</li>
